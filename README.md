# Star Trek Quiz

### Purpose
The Star Trek Quiz page is designed to be a fun quiz for those interested in Star Trek. It has a quiz that asks questions about the star trek shows. It gives the user a result at the end depending on their score and has a name generator that the user can click to get a random Star Trek name and species. 
As this website is designed for those interested in Star Trek the game page is designed to resemble one of the consoles from the enterprise. Along with using images from the show and the Star Trek logo for brand recognition.

# Target Audience
The target audience for this website are people who are looking for a fun online Star Trek quiz. It is geared towards people with an interest in Star Trek but anyone could enjoy the site.

# User Stories
### First Time Visitor Goals
As a first-time visitor I want to easily be able to understand the purpose of the site – eg that this is a quiz about Star Trek. I want to be able to easily navigate to the quiz page. I also want to get additional information on the show.

### Returning Visitor Goals
As a returning visitor I want to be able to take the quiz again to see if I can improve my score. I want to be able to go to the shows page and get more information on the shows. 

### Frequent Visitor Goals
As a frequent visitor I want to be able to check if there are new questions added to the quiz or name generator. Or any new feartures added in general.

# Design
### Colour scheme
Star Trek has a distinct colour scheme which I aimed to stick as closely to as possible. I have taken the main inspiration from the show The Next Generation (As the shows do vary slightly in their styling and this is my personal favourite and the most recognisable). My aim was to have the quiz resemble a console from TNG as closely as possible. 
The below image is a selection of the colours of the console screens in TNG and this is what I have selected from.

### Logo
For the website Logo I have used an image of the Star Trek Logo taken from the original series. This is a very recognisable font and logo which would draw the user’s interest and create instant brand recognition.

### Text

### Imagery 
For the background of the main page, I have used an image of space and stars. It is fitting with theme of the website while also not being too busy and letting the text be the focus. The home page has a gif of the enterprise. The game page has imagery of a console from the enterprise to give the user the impression that they are playing the game on a star ship console. The end page uses various images of TNG depending on the score.
